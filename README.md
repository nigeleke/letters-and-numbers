# Letters and Numbers

## Introduction

This repository started life as sample programs for a presentation on Prolog, leading up to an implementation of Letters and Numbers.

It has since become a breeding ground for other Letters and Numbers examples.

## Prolog

Demo Prolog programs for a presentation, based on an article published in Overload for the [ACCU](https://members.accu.org/index.php) and
presented to the [Ulladulla Software Developers](https://nigel-eke.com/ulladulla-software-developers) many years later.

## Scala

I was interested to see how Scala, being an expressive and concise language, was able to handle the Letters and Numbers problem.

This was later extended as to compile to ScalaJS, and explore a ScalaJS/Laminar front-end. 

```
Warning - The Laminar code and constructs are not pretty - especially wrt to signal handling and reactiveness - (based on lack of experience in both ScalaJS and Laminar)
```

## Rust

This is my first Rust program, so don't take this as an idiomatic way to write Rust. Nevertheless I wanted a reasonable sized sample program to get my teeth stuck into.
