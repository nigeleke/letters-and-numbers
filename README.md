# Letters and Numbers

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of two independent projects.

  * Demo Prolog programs for Presentation - leading up to an implementation of Letters and Numbers.
    Based on an article published in Overload for the [ACCU](https://members.accu.org/index.php) and
    presented to the [Ulladulla Software Developers](https://nigel-eke.com/ulladulla-software-developers)
    many years later.

  * A Scala implementation of Letters and Numbers, which is fully compiled by ScalaJS, to work
    alongside a ScalaJS/Laminar front-end. 
    * Warning - The Laminar code and constructs are not pretty - especially wrt to signal handling
      and reactiveness - (based on lack of experience in both ScalaJS and Laminar)
