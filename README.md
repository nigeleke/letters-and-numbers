# Letters and Numbers

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of three independent projects.

  * Demo Prolog programs for Presentation - leading up to an implementation of Letters and Numbers.
    Based on an article published in Overload for the ACCU. https://members.accu.org/index.php
  * A Scala implementation of Letters and Numbers.
  * A ScalaJS/Laminar front-end.  Warning - The Laminar code and constructs are not pretty (based on
    lack of experience in both ScalaJS and Laminar)

## Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
